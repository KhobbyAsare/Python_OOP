"""Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), including in Python. It refers to the 
bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. 
This helps in restricting direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components, which can prevent the accidental 
modification of data.

In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers:

Public members: Accessible from anywhere outside the class.
Protected members: Accessible within the class and its subclasses. These are prefixed with a single underscore (_).
Private members: Accessible only within the class. These are prefixed with double underscores (__).
"""


"""
# Encapsulation restrict users from directly accessing and modifying data,
# So they have the opportunity to give it a value at the initialization level and after that they can't modify it
