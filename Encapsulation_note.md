Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), including in Python. It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. This helps in restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.

In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers:
- **Public members**: Accessible from anywhere outside the class.
- **Protected members**: Accessible within the class and its subclasses. These are prefixed with a single underscore (`_`).
- **Private members**: Accessible only within the class. These are prefixed with double underscores (`__`).

Here's a simple example to illustrate encapsulation in Python:

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name          # Public attribute
        self._salary = salary     # Protected attribute
        self.__bonus = 0          # Private attribute

    def set_bonus(self, bonus):
        self.__bonus = bonus      # Public method to set private attribute

    def get_bonus(self):
        return self.__bonus       # Public method to get private attribute

# Creating an instance of Employee
emp = Employee("John", 50000)

# Accessing public attribute
print(emp.name)  # Output: John

# Accessing protected attribute (not recommended)
print(emp._salary)  # Output: 50000

# Accessing private attribute (will raise an AttributeError)
# print(emp.__bonus)  # Uncommenting this line will raise an error

# Using public methods to access private attribute
emp.set_bonus(5000)
print(emp.get_bonus())  # Output: 5000
```

In this example:
- `name` is a public attribute.
- `_salary` is a protected attribute.
- `__bonus` is a private attribute, which can only be accessed through the `set_bonus` and `get_bonus` methods¹².
