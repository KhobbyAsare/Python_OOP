"""
Abstraction Shows the necessary attributes and hides the unnecessary properties from users
"""

"""Abstraction is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), including in Python. It involves hiding the 
complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This helps in reducing 
programming complexity and effort.

In Python, abstraction is typically achieved using abstract classes and methods. An abstract class is a class that 
cannot be instantiated and often includes one or more abstract methods. These methods are declared but contain no 
implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class are expected to provide implementations for these abstract methods."""


"""
Example of Abstraction in Python
Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate abstraction using the abc module in Python:

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

# Creating instances of Dog and Cat
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(dog.sound())  # Output: Bark
print(cat.sound())  # Output: Meow

"""

"""
In this example:

Animal is an abstract class with an abstract method sound().
Dog and Cat are subclasses of Animal and provide their own implementations of the sound() method.
Benefits of Abstraction
# Simplifies Code: By hiding complex details, abstraction makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
# Enhances Reusability: Abstract classes can be reused across different programs.
# Improves Flexibility: Changes in the abstract class do not affect the subclasses, as long as the interface remains consistent.
